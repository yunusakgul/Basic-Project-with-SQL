# Basic-Project-with-SQL
Basic Project to use Sql functions along the way

The main idea behind this project is to use what I've been learning about SQL, it will not be about EDA, at least not until I've learned enough.

I believe best way to learn a software is to use it. I have been attending online courses from websites(such as Datacamp,Coursera). I am going to wonder something about the 
open-base datasets then I am going to try finding the solution. It'd be better if I use Python for visualization along the way, but I am not there yet.

I am going to use the movies dataset, I found on Kaggle, also can be found it repository.

Here is a summary of data types and columns:

First I would like to order most liked movies: 

Datasets I downloaded was splitted in two, covering different years. I needed to combine this in order to get one.

It would be nice to compare most winning genres, to see there is a popular or more profitable than the others.
