# Basic-Project-with-SQL
Basic Project to use Sql functions along the way

The main idea behind this project is to use what I've been learning about SQL, it will not be about EDA, at least not until I've learned enough.

I believe best way to learn a software is to use it. I have been attending online courses from websites(such as Datacamp,Coursera). I am going to wonder something about the 
open-base datasets then I am going to try finding the solution. It'd be better if I use Python for visualization along the way, but I am not there yet.

I am going to use the movies dataset, I found on Kaggle, also can be found it repository.

Here is a summary of data types and columns:

table_name	column_name	col_type
df_movie_ratings	field1	INTEGER
df_movie_ratings	movie	TEXT
df_movie_ratings	year	INTEGER
df_movie_ratings	imdb	REAL
df_movie_ratings	metascore	INTEGER
df_movie_ratings	votes	INTEGER
df_movie_ratings	genre	TEXT
df_movie_ratings	runtime	TEXT
df_movie_ratings	gross	REAL
df_movie_ratings	n_imdb	REAL
movie_ratings	field1	INTEGER
movie_ratings	movie	TEXT
movie_ratings	year	TEXT
movie_ratings	imdb	REAL
movie_ratings	metascore	INTEGER
movie_ratings	votes	INTEGER
movie_ratings	genre	TEXT
movie_ratings	runtime	INTEGER
movie_ratings	gross	TEXT
