The main idea to create this project is to help me use everything I've been learning about Sql. I am not aiming to make a solid Data Analysis project,
but I am hoping this will get me there some day. 

To take a look the reigning champion in the 100 metres Backstroke Swimming Men field:

SELECT Name, EVENT, Games, 
LAG(Name) OVER(ORDER BY Games ASC) as Last_champ
FROM olympics
WHERE (Medal = 'Gold') AND Year > 1950 AND Event LIKE '%100 metres Backstroke' AND Event like '%Swimming Men%'
ORDER BY Games;
